## Introduction

This is a replication package for the paper "Open Source Software Development Tool Installation: Challenges and Strategies For Novice Developers".

## Folders explanation

The folder "TranscriptsEMSE" contains the transcripts extracted from the 24 think-aloud sessions. In the transcripts, we highlighted the *challenges* using the colour *pink*, and the *strategies* using the colour *green*. The text highlighted in *yellow* indicates statements, questions or observations made by the *observer*. 

The screenshots of the participants during the installation process are included in the transcripts as well. We further anonymise the participants' identity by occluding it with a stripe.

The folder "DataAnalysis" contains a spreadsheet file with the analysis of challenges, strategies, and sources. Within this spreadsheet, you will find seven sheets:

- **Participant Info:** Analysis of the questionnaire responses from participants.  
- **Source:** Mapping of all sources used for their respective queries during the think-aloud sessions.  
- **Validation Survey:** Analysis of the responses from the validation survey.  
- **Challenges - Initial Analysis:** Preliminary analysis of challenges extracted from the transcripts.  
- **Strategies - Initial Analysis:** Initial analysis of strategies identified in the transcripts.  
- **Complete Analysis:** Finalised mapping of sources, challenges, and strategies.  
- **Source Analysis:** Mapping of relationships between challenges, strategies, and sources.
