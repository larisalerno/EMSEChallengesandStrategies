## Introduction

This is a replication package for the paper "Open Source Software Development Tool Installation: Challenges and Strategies For Novice Developers".

## Folder explanation

The folder "TranscriptsEMSE" contains the transcripts extracted from the 24 think-aloud sessions. In the transcripts, we highlighted the *challenges* using the colour *pink*, and the *strategies* using the colour *green*. The text highlighted in *yellow* indicates statements, questions or observations made by the *observer*. 

The screenshots of the participants during the installation process are included in the transcripts as well. We further anonymise the participants' identity by occluding it with a stripe.
